## Task Log

Use this format:

### Task N — Title

- Status:
- Summary:
- Validation:
- Commit:
- Notes:

### Task 1 — Repository Foundation

- Status: Done
- Summary: Created base Python project directories (`src/readmatch_ai/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`) with minimal placeholders.
- Validation: N/A (structure only; tooling not yet configured)
- Commit: 9fc69ce
- Notes: Package name `readmatch_ai` (src layout). Pre-existing unrelated uncommitted deletion of `docs/agent/architecture/*` left untouched.

### Task 2 — Development Tooling

- Status: Done
- Summary: Added `pyproject.toml` with ruff, mypy (strict), and pytest configuration. Dev dependencies installed via `pip3 install --user --break-system-packages -e ".[dev]"` (system venv module unavailable: missing `python3.14-venv`, no sudo access). Added `.gitignore` for build/cache artifacts.
- Validation: `python3 -m ruff check src tests` (pass), `python3 -m mypy src` (pass), `python3 -m pytest -q` (no tests collected — expected, tests added in Task 3)
- Commit: ef3c6ca
- Notes: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, Next.js intentionally excluded per Task scope.

### Task 3 — Validation

- Status: Done
- Summary: Added minimal smoke test (`tests/test_smoke.py`) so pytest has something to collect, confirming the lint/typecheck/test commands all work end-to-end.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m ruff check src tests` — pass
  - `python3 -m mypy src tests` — pass (3 source files)
  - `python3 -m pytest -q` — pass (1 passed)
- Commit: b71f3b4
- Notes: Commands run directly (no Makefile/task-runner introduced — out of Task scope).

### Task 4 — Project Progress

- Status: Done
- Summary: Updated Current State section (Phase, Sprint, Last Completed Task, Last Commit, Validation) and back-filled Task 1-3 commit hashes.
- Validation: N/A (documentation-only update)
- Commit: (recorded after commit)
- Notes: —

## Current Constraints

- Implement only approved Tasks.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Update this file after validated completion.
